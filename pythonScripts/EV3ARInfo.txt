Purpose: holds information for users of EV3ARScript


##################### INFO ##########################

Goal: work with your team to move your EV3 robot through an obstacle course!
Using the augmented reality app, you can "see" what the robot is sensing.
Note: EV3 sensors are not the most advanced or accurate. It is helpful to use AR
to see the limitations of the sensors and the capabilities of the EV3.
In addition, there will be a bit of delay in the AR visualizations in the app,
due to a time lag while uploading data.
The data will update fully if EV3 is paused for several seconds.

-------------------------------------------------------------

FUNCTIONS AVAILABLE:
--getDist(): returns distance from nearest obstacle in cm
--getColor(): returns color the EV3 is currently detecting;
  colors available are: 'unknown','black','blue','green','yellow','red','white','brown'
--getAngle(): returns angle offset from starting position (0 to 360 degrees)
--getTouch(): returns 1 if touch sensor is pushed, 0 if not; takes ~2 seconds to update;
  sensor must be held down for result
--forward(numSeconds,speed): moves robot forward for numSeconds; speed is optional argument;
  default speed is 35
--backward(numSeconds,speed): moves robot backward for numSeconds; speed is optional argument; 
  default speed is 35
--left(numDegrees): turns robot left numDegrees (0-360); accurate to approx 5 degrees
--right(numDegrees): turns robot right numDegrees (0-360); accurate to approx 5 degrees
--stop(): stops robot movement
--sleep(decimal/integer): pauses for given amount of time
--print("body of print"): prints debug statements to terminal
--printAR("hello world"): prints debug statements to text panel in AR app

NOTE: The program will end after all your code is finished running.

Feel free to use conditional statements (while, if, etc) and other methods 
to move your robot through the obstacle course!

----------------------------------------------------------------

Example code: 
   while (getColor() != 'green'):
       forward(1)
   stop()
   left(90)
   forward(2,40)
   stop()
   forward(1)
